> Establish and verify a professional Python project for continuous intelligence.

## Project Overview

Author: Denise Case

Date: 2026 October

First project in the Continuous Intelligence course.

The goal is to establish a working Python environment,
explore a professional project structure,
run a Python pipeline, and verify the project works.

The project is configured in
[pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml).

## Data

No input dataset is required for this project.

Later modules introduce data files, analytical processing,
and generated results.

## Approach

The project uses a simple Python pipeline to verify
that the environment and project structure work correctly.

Explore these important project components:

- [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) - project identity, dependencies, and tool configuration.
- [src/cintel/pipeline.py](src/cintel/pipeline.py) - executable Python pipeline and logging.
- [tests/](tests/) - automated tests.
- [.github/workflows/](.github/workflows/) - automated testing and documentation deployment.
- [docs/](docs/) - project documentation.
- [zensical.toml](zensical.toml) - project documentation configuration must have correct links.

## Run the Project

Follow the [Professional Python Workflow Guide](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/)
to set up your machine and project environment.

From a VS Code terminal in the project root:

```shell
uv run python -m cintel.pipeline
```

## Results

Successful execution produces a terminal message:

```shell
========================
Pipeline executed successfully!
========================
```

A `project.log` file is created in the project root.

This confirms that the Python pipeline executes
and the logging system works.

## Verification

Run the automated tests:

```shell
uv run pytest
```

## Project Documentation

The [hosted documentation site](https://denisecase.github.io/cintel-01-getting-started/)
is published using Zensical and GitHub Pages.

The documentation site is used to present the project report,
covering such sections as data, methods, results, visualizations,
interpretation, and conclusions.

## CI/CD and GitHub Actions

This project includes continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)
to check project files and publish the docs.
GitHub Actions include:

- [CI: Python and Documentation Checks](https://github.com/denisecase/cintel-01-getting-started/actions/workflows/ci-python-zensical.yml)
- [CD: Documentation Deployment](https://github.com/denisecase/cintel-01-getting-started/actions/workflows/deploy-zensical.yml)

## Developer Reference

Follow the
[Professional Python Workflow Guide](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/)
for **detailed instructions and troubleshooting**.

### Initialize and Update the Python Environment

With the project open in VS Code, open a VS Code terminal.
Paste each command and hit Enter or Return after to run it.

```shell
uvx pup-clean --delete
uv self update
uv python pin 3.14
uv python install
uv lock --upgrade
uv sync
uv audit
```

### Set Up and Run Git Hooks

Set up and run the git hooks to perform
basic checks automatically before
any changes get pushed to GitHub.

In the VS Code terminal,
paste each command and hit Enter or Return after to run it.

```shell
uv run prek install --force
uv run prek update --freeze --cooldown-days 7

git add -A
uv run prek run --all-files
# repeat if changes were made
uv run prek run --all-files
```

### Run Common Chores

Run linters, formatters, type checks, tests, and
build the documentation.

```shell
uv run ruff check . --fix
uv run ruff format .

uv run ty check
uv run python -m pytest
uv run python -m zensical build
```

### Git add-commit-push to GitHub

After making useful changes, save your work to GitHub.

```shell
git add -A
git commit -m "describe your changes in quotes"
git push -u origin main
```

## Developer Notes

- Use the **UP ARROW** and **DOWN ARROW** in the terminal to scroll through past commands.
- Use `CTRL+f` to find (and replace) text within a file.
