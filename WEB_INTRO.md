# Introduction to Web Technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

When building web-based dashboards for continuous intelligence and interactive analytics,
it's helpful to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
These three technologies work together to create interactive and visually appealing web pages.

Here's a quick introduction - go for exposure and recognition rather than mastery.
What you use a lot, you'll learn.

## HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

HTML provides the structure and content of a web page.
It consists of a set of tags that define the elements on a page,
such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and tables.
HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and are used to mark up
the different parts of a web page.

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS is used to enhance the presentation and styling of HTML elements.
With CSS, you can control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects
of the web page.
CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and applies styles to them.
Keeping CSS in a separate file allows graphic designers to implement branding, etc.,
while analysts and developers focus on the structure and content defined by HTML.
Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that provides a set of pre-built components
that help make our pages look great on all screen sizes. There's also Material Design Bootstrap, and many more. Being able to use these frameworks can help create professional-looking dashboards quickly.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to add interactivity
and dynamic behavior to web pages.
With JavaScript, you can handle user interactions, manipulate HTML and CSS,
perform calculations, fetch data from servers, and much more.
JavaScript runs directly in the web browser (no installation needed!) and works in conjunction with HTML and CSS.

## The Document Object Model (DOM)

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML documents.
It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects, e.g. the html node has 2 child nodes: head and body.
Programming languages can connect to the page, and we can change a page by writing logic.

## Exposure, Not Mastery

Learning a bit about these foundational web technologies complements your
analytics skills and enables you to create engaging and
interactive dashboards.
As we progress, we'll explore frameworks and libraries that help analysts build powerful web applications and dashboards.

These core technologies are useful, incredibly common, and relatively easy to learn.
Don't memorize. Just learn the terms and experiment. When you need to learn more,
